This folder contains a basic test suite for Whitespace interpreters.

This test suite is intended to verify the operation of each instruction
of a Whitespace interpreter, via basic black-box testing.

The suite consists of a test runner and a set of test cases, with each
test case being a separate Whitespace source file, that also contains
comments describing both the program itself and its expected output.

It only assumes these things about the interpreter being tested:
- it takes the name of the program file to be executed as an argument
- it uses stdin and stdout for the program's input and output
- it reads and outputs numbers in decimal form

The first few tests try to verify that exit, push and output works, as
all the rest of the tests rely on this (out of necessity, due to the
black-box nature of the test suite). If any one of those fails, the rest
of the tests are likely to show spurious failures.

The current test runner script assumes the interpreter is in the current
working directory, and that the test cases are in the same directory as
the test runner (which is not necessarily the CWD). It looks for an
executable file named "whitespace" or "direct", and if not found, uses
"go run ." as the interpreter. The code for this is at the top of the
script file, to be easy to change if you need to do so.
